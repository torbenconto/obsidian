Hey There! I noticed you just moved in, and I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Torben. I am a 14-year-old sophomore enrolled at North Hall High School. Coding and learning about technology are my favorite things to do in my free time. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I do not currently participate in extracurriculars at North Hall, but I plan to join TSA. I always try to push myself academically, whether through my classes, extracurriculars, or studies outside of school. A fun fact about me is that I have been mountain biking for over a decade, and it is still one of my favorite things to do. Traveling is a big part of my family, so don’t worry if you see us out of the house for a few weeks over the summer. My family and I are excited to see a new neighbor, and we can’t wait to get to know you.

Hello, My name is Torben Conto. I'm 14 years old and a sophomore at North Hall High School. I have over 5 years of experience with coding, which has helped me develop essential logic and critical thinking skills. I also mentor classmates in these fields, which has helped to improve my collaborative skills. I take academics very seriously and strive to push myself both inside and outside of the classroom. I am a member of the STEM program at North Hall High School, which has provided me with the resources necessary to further my knowledge and pursue my passion for mathematics and technology. Throughout my time in the STEM program, I have built strong teamwork and communication skills through group engineering projects such as CAD modeling, structural models with wood, and various robotics projects. I am confident that the skills I have learned will help me on the path to success. Thank you for your time.

### Point of view - 1st or 3rd
How many minds the writer is going in to (3rd person)
Objective: none
Omniscient: 2 or more
Limited: 1

1st person and 3rd person limited are very similar. They both focus on one character but 3rd person limited allows for comments on the situation where in 1st person the writer gives up their identity to become a character.

More intimate writing is less reliable.

Detached 1st person and centered 1st person.
Sometimes a fiction writer will use a faulty 1st person in order to create elements like irony.


1st: "I walked down the street and saw the bright green lamppost."
3rd: "He walked down the street and spotted the bright green lamppost."

### Diction - word choice by an author
Informal language: "John walked down the street and saw his buddy."
Formal language: "John walked down the street and spotted one of his friends."

### Syntax - what sorts of sentences does the author use
Long sentences: "My friend waltzed down the street gracefully and stopped at the bus station near the news stand."
Short sentences: "My friend stopped at the bus station."

Good writers use sentence variety and use short sentences to clarify on occasion.

### Imagery - language that appeals to the senses
Even in a factual or persuasive essay, good imagery engages the reader.

Appealing to touch: "I ran my hand down the bricks which were coated in the early morning dew".
Appealing to smell: "Walking by Sally's bake shop, the sweet aroma of pastries and cakes graced my nose."

### Figurative Language - more than literal.
Literal - "Jose is doing very well this game!"
Figurative - "Jose is on fire!"

## Theme
What is the writer saying about the way the world is or the way people are?

## Thucydides
People are all equal, it is not your talent or inherent ability that make you better than a man, it's what you've been taught and how much you have pushed yourself.
