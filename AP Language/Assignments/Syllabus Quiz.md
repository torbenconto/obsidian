	Writing rhetorical analyses.
- ### CR13
	Routinely reading aloud in class from essays in order to receive and give critiques.

## Classroom Atmosphere
Dr. Rob follows "The Cleric" (Geoffrey Chaucer) and he takes it as a good model to follow for teaching. He says that civil discourse is very important and that everyone should feel safe to express and discuss unique viewpoints in class.

He says that the classroom should be separate from the lunch room or locker room and lists these rules.
1. Be in your seat when the bell rings
2. Listen
3. Speak thoughtfully
4. Be kind
5. Don't eat
6. "Leave your cell phone turned off in the deepest darkest depths of your book bag. If you cannot live and hour without touching your cell phone, please drop this class **immediately**"

## Grading
C - Satisfactory
B - Commendable, approaches mastery
A - Outstanding, shows mastery
F - Unacceptable

## Grade Allocation
40% - Daily Work
60% - Assessments

If absent, be prepared to make it up/submit the day you return.

## Rubric
An **A** on a paper meets this criteria:
1. A significant topic with logical development of a central idea with sound evidence
2. Effective organization with transitions and unity
3. Variety in sentence structure
4. Appropriate diction
5. No major grammatical errors

## Major Errors
*EG: Awkward, Agreement, Sentence Fragments, Fused Sentences, Verb Errors, Logic, Coherence* (what he wrote, dont @ me)
You have the option of submitting rewrites for extra grades on the **first 8** essays. Only essays which are submitted on time qualify for additional credit.

## Format
MLA format, no title page but you need a first page with this info at the top left:
1. Your Name
2. Your Class Pd.
3. The Assignment (*EG: Essay 1*)
4. The Date
Next, centered on the page write the *Statement of Purpose* which he has given for the essay. The Statement of Purpose should be copied *verbatim on every essay*. Below write the title you have chosen.

## Plagiarism
Encouraged to discuss ideas with other students as well as proofread. Anyone who plagiarizes forfeits their right to be trusted and gives up their integrity. **The consequence of plagiarism is a zero on the essay.** Most students who plagiarize fail the course.

For proper quoting you must use quotation marks (duh). For proper paraphrasing the writer must indicate where the paraphrase beings and state the source at the end of the passage (duh).

All writing outside of class is submitted via [turnitin.com](https://turnitin.com) which flags AI and plagiarism.

## Journals
#### A: 
In response to lectures he will ask you to take notes, date them, and keep them in the journal. If he writes something on the board, you should write it down.

#### B:
He will ask you to write journal entries each week. Each entry should be numbered and dated. Some will be specific responses and some will be prep for essays. Keep them all in a single document. **Periodically, without notice he will check the journal entries for a grade.** (basically hargis quotes but on giga steroids)

## Work Load
1 hour of homework a night

## Late Work
If you know before that an assignment will be late (for a good reason) you should notify Dr. Rob before the fact. For every day an essay is late, 10 pts are taken off. Homework not accepted late unless you have an excused absence. If you are tardy and miss a quiz, it's a 0.

## Texts
The Scarlet Letter
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
The Great Gatsby

## Quizzes
Unannounced quizzes on dates when reading assignments are due. 5-10 questions. If they are oral exams, he will read the question twice and no more.

## Materials
Blue or black pen, notebook paper (no ragged edges), charged laptop

## Outline (no need to summarize)
