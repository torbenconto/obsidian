Frames operate at the Data Link Layer ([[Layer 2]]) of the [[OSI model]].

Used to encapsulate data packets for transmission over a physical network. A frame includes not only the data payload but also control information such as source and destination [[MAC address]]es, error detection codes, and [[Frame]] delimiters.

A frame typically consists of a header (with addressing and control information), the payload (which is the data being transmitted), and a trailer (which often contains error-checking information like a Frame Check Sequence (FCS)).

[[Frame]]s are primarily concerned with ensuring that data is correctly transmitted from one device to another on the same local network segment (e.g., an Ethernet network).
